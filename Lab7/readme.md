## File Compression
### Purpose of File Compression
The purpose of file compression is to make file sizes smaller. Smaller file sizes allow files to be uploaded and downloaded faster than files with larger sizes.
### Compression and File Size
SVG files are generally much large than JPG files. This is because JPG files are already compressed using lossy compression. My SVG graphic went from 599KB to 382KB after being compressed.

## Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and the Shark Class
### Attributes: name, age
The name attribute keeps track of the name of a shark object and is used to describe which shark is doing something. Age would also be an attribute if it was used.
### Methods: swim(self), be_awesome(self)
The swim method prints the name of the shark object followed by the string "is swimming.". The be_awesome method prints the name of the shark object followed by the string " is being awesome."
### Constructor: \__init\__(self, name)
The purpose of the constructor is to initialize the data of an instantiated object. The constructor of the shark class takes the parameters self and name. The self parameter is a reference to an object that is made based on the shark class. The name parameter is used to give a name to the shark object. The constructor sets the instantiated object's name attribute to the value of the name parameter.
### Class vs. Object
A class is a blueprint for an object created by a programmer. A class defines attributes and methods that can be used by an object of the class. An object is an instance of a class. This means an object is its own seperate entity that follows the rules and definitions set by a class. To "instantiate an object from a class" is to initialize an object based on the definition that is set by the class for that object.
