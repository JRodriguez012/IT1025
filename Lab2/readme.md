## Hardware
### Hard Drives and Memory
#### Latency and Transfer Rates
Latency rates include both seek time and rotational latency. Seek time is the amount of time it takes a hard drive's read/write head to find the physical location of a piece of data. Rotational latency is the time it takes for the location that is being accessed to rotate into position under a head, after a seek. Transfer rate is the speed at which data is transferred to and from the disk platter. Latency is the time it takes to find a piece of data and move it into position to be accessed, while transfer rate is the speed it takes access that data.
#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives
Unlike hard drives, solid state drives have no moving parts. Rather than being physically written onto a disk, data is split into word length pieces and stored in memory. Data can then be accessed almost instantly using unique system-wide addresses, similar to RAM. Solid state drives have no latency because there is no physical disk that needs to be rotated into location for data to be accessed. This allows data to be fragmented without affecting the performance of the solid state drive. As there are no moving parts, solid state drives are also less likely to have mechanical problems.
