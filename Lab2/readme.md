### Hard Drives and Memory
#### Latency and Transfer Rates
Latency rates include both seek time and rotational latency. Seek time is the amount of time it takes a hard drive's read/write head to find the physical location of a piece of data. Rotational latency is the time it takes for the location that is being accessed to rotate into position under a head, after a seek. Transfer rate is the speed at which data is transferred to and from the disk platter. Latency is the time it takes to find a piece of data and move it into position to be accessed, while transfer rate is the speed it takes access that data.
