The purpose of Lab 1 is to explore the IT1025 course set-up, examine the history of computing and get up and running with GitHub. IT1025 covers a wide-range of computing topics with a primary goal of assisting in determining student passions in IT.  IT history has many interesting facets. One of particular interest was... Regardless of one's passion in IT, frameworks such as GitHub are useful to create, update and maintain any type of file and work in an organized repository.

## GitHub
Github is an example of "Client-Server" architecture. Github allows users to share files from their computer, the client, by uploading them to be stored on Github's server. Github also allows users to see files stored on their server that were uploaded by other clients and download those files.
### Client - Server Architecture
A "Client-Server" architecture is a network of computers in which one or more computers called "clients" communicate back and forth with a central computer called a "server".

### Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the ability to use another computer's resources over the internet. Typically, cloud computing is used for data storage. A user can upload data to be stored on a server and that data can be viewed or retrieved at any time, rather than using their own system's storage. One example of this is iCloud which is used by Apple users to store photos, documents, contacts, etc.

Through the course of this lab I learned about the course requirements for IT1025 as well as an overview of client-server architecture and GitHub.  I found GitHub to be interesting but initially had difficulty creating a respoitory.  I revisited the process but was still stumped so I contacted my instructor and with a few pointers was then able to complete the process successfully. I look forward to spending more time on GitHub and eventually learning about database which I believe is my current IT passion.
