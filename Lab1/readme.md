## Executive Summary
In Lab 1, we learn the how to setup a GitHub repository and the history and components of information systems. GitHub is an incredibly useful tool for collaborative and organized development. Understanding the components of information systems and how they work together allows us to have a better understanding of information systems as a whole. The history of information systems shows the beginnings of much of the technology that is still in use today. I found the PC revolution and the transition of computers from being a business product to a household product to be the most interesting. Learning the concept of information systems can help us to see the value in a tool like GitHub for creation, development, and collaboration.

## Information System Components
- Hardware (ex. computer)
- Software (ex. Microsoft Windows)
- Data (ex. address)
- People (ex. developer)
- Processes (ex. automation)

## GitHub
Github is an example of "Client-Server" architecture. Github allows users to share files from their computer, the client, by uploading them to be stored on Github's server. Github also allows users to see files stored on their server that were uploaded by other clients and download those files.
### Client - Server Architecture
A "Client-Server" architecture is a network of computers in which one or more computers called "clients" communicate back and forth with a central computer called a "server". The server is able to determine which clients have access to various data.

### Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the ability to use another computer's resources over the internet. Typically, cloud computing is used for data storage. A user can upload data to be stored on a server and that data can be viewed or retrieved at any time, rather than using their own system's storage. One example of cloud computing is iCloud which is used by Apple users to store photos, documents, contacts, etc.

## Conclusion
During this lab I learned what is to be expected for IT1025, how and why to use GitHub, and the concept of information systems. Furthermore, I learned the basics and use of client-server architecture and cloud computing. I found creating a GitHub account and setting up a repository to be simple. I have a better understanding of why GitHub is so widely used. I am most excited to learn about graphics as I have a love for video games and animation.
