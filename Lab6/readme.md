## Internet Architecture
### Internet Protocol
#### IP Address
Internet Protocol (IP) address is a unique number assigned to a specific computer that is connected to the internet. IPv4 is the original version of an IP address. IPv4 address are made up of four numbers between 0 and 255, separated by dots. IPv4 can only have around four billion unique IP addresses which is not enough for the number of internet devices used today. IPv6 was developed to increase the number of available IP addresses. IPv6 addresses are made up of eight hexadecimal numbers, separated by colons. IPv6 has enough space for 340 undecillion addresses.
#### ICANN
ICANN is a not-for-profit public-benefit corporation with a mission of keeping the internet secure and stable. ICANN is the operator of Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions and allocates IP address blocks to the five Regional Internet Registries (RIR) around the world. Those RIRs then allocate smaller blocks to Internet Service Providers (ISP). The ISPs then assign address to individual internet connections. ICANN is at the top of the herachy for distributing IP addresses.
### TCP/IP
#### Responsibility of TCP/IP
Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is responsible for defining the details of how data is sent and received through network communication hardware. TCP/IP is designed such that each computer has a unique IP adress and each IP address can send and receive data over different ports.
#### Client-Server Model and TCP/IP
In a TCP/IP connection, the "server" is a computer that is "listening" for incoming connections and chooses to either accept or reject those connections. The "client" is a computer that attempts to initiate a connection with the server, therefore the client needs to know the IP address of the server to connect to. Once a connection between the client and server, data can be sent in either direction across the network. This connection remains open until either the client or server terminates the connection. 
#### Layers
Layers are important to changing technology because individual layers can be modified without affecting any of the other layers. This allows us to remain flexible and stops us from having to make changes to the entire software each time an individual layer is changed.
#### Application Layer
Application protocols run on the "application" layer. HTTP, FTP, POP3, SMTP, SNMP are application protocols that run on the application layer of the TCP/IP protocol suite.

## Internet Security
### HTTP and Client-Server Model
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a protocol used for viewing web pages.
### Protocols for Secure HTTP

## Securing your Web Browser
### Reasons to Secure Browser
As web browsers are frequently used, you should secure your browser to reduce the risk of your computer being compromised. An unsecure browser can lead to computer problems caused potentially by spyware being installed or even an intruder taking control of your computer. Attackers often compromise computers by exploiting vulnerabilities in web browsers through compromised or malicious websites. 
### Risk Explained
JavaScript is a scripting language that allows web page authors to add more interactivity to a web page. This capability can be abused by attackers introducing vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting. Cross-Site Scripting permits an attacker to leverage the trust that you have with a website. This could potentially allow an attacker to collect your personal data through another site.

## Internet Programming
### World Wide Web Consortium
Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of the World Wide Web and director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). W3C is a Web standards organization which develops specifications, guidelines, software, and tools to lead the Web to its full potential. The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a standard that uses a text-based format for representing structured information such as documents, data, transactions, etc. XML is important for reliably sharing structured information locally and across networks between programs, between people, or between computers and people.
