## Internet Architecture
### Internet Protocol
#### IP Address
Internet Protocol (IP) address is a unique number assigned to a specific computer that is connected to the internet. IPv4 is the original version of an IP address. IPv4 address are made up of four numbers between 0 and 255, separated by dots. IPv4 can only have around four billion unique IP addresses which is not enough for the number of internet devices used today. IPv6 was developed to increase the number of available IP addresses. IPv6 addresses are made up of eight hexadecimal numbers, separated by colons. IPv6 has enough space for 340 undecillion addresses.
#### ICANN
ICANN is a not-for-profit public-benefit corporation with a mission of keeping the internet secure and stable. ICANN is the operator of Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions and allocates IP address blocks to the five Regional Internet Registries (RIR) around the world. Those RIRs then allocate smaller blocks to Internet Service Providers (ISP). The ISPs then assign address to individual internet connections. ICANN is at the top of the herachy for distributing IP addresses.
### TCP/IP
#### Responsibility of TCP/IP
Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is responsible for defining the details of how data is sent and received through network communication hardware. TCP/IP is designed such that each computer has a unique IP adress and each IP address can send and receive data over different ports.
#### Client-Server Model and TCP/IP
In a TCP/IP connection, the "server" is a computer that is "listening" for incoming connections and chooses to either accept or reject those connections. The "client" is a computer that attempts to initiate a connection with the server, therefore the client needs to know the IP address of the server to connect to. Once a connection between the client and server, data can be sent in either direction across the network. This connection remains open until either the client or server terminates the connection. 
#### Layers
Layers are important to changing technology because individual layers can be modified without affecting any of the other layers. This allows us to remain flexible and stops us from having to make changes to the entire software each time an individual layer is changed.
#### Application Layer
Application protocols run on the "application" layer. HTTP, FTP, POP3, SMTP, SNMP are application protocols that run on the application layer of the TCP/IP protocol suite.

## Internet Security
### HTTP and Client-Server Model
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a protocol used for viewing web pages.
### Protocols for Secure HTTP

## Securing your Web Browser
### Reasons to Secure Browser
As web browsers are frequently used, you should secure your browser to reduce the risk of your computer being compromised. An unsecure browser can lead to computer problems caused potentially by spyware being installed or even an intruder taking control of your computer. Attackers often compromise computers by exploiting vulnerabilities in web browsers through compromised or malicious websites. 
### Risk Explained
JavaScript is a scripting language that allows web page authors to add more interactivity to a web page. This capability can be abused by attackers introducing vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting. Cross-Site Scripting permits an attacker to leverage the trust that you have with a website. This could potentially allow an attacker to collect your personal data through another site.

## Internet Programming
### World Wide Web Consortium
Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of the World Wide Web and director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). W3C is a Web standards organization which develops specifications, guidelines, software, and tools to lead the Web to its full potential. The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a standard that uses a text-based format for representing structured information such as documents, data, transactions, etc. XML is important for reliably sharing structured information locally and across networks between programs, between people, or between computers and people.
### HTML5 and CSS
Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages. HTML is used to describe the structure and content that makes up a web page. Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) is used to format the layout of a web page. CSS alows you to control the colors of fonts and backgrounds, the size of text, spacing between elements, etc. I used HTML and CSS to make a web page that talks about horror movies. I used HTML to display the text for the web page and link to a Rotten Tomatoes list of horror movies. I used CSS to change the background color to red, change the color of the text and link to white, change the sizes of and center the elements, and add a border around the paragraph.
### HTML and XML
Extensible Markup Language (XML) is used to store and transport data. XML does not do anything. HTML is designed to data, while XML is designed to carry data. Unlike HTML, XML does not have any predefined tags. XML's tags are defined by the author of the XML document.
## Components of a URL
#### Scheme: https
Every URL begins with the scheme. The scheme tells the browser what type of address the URL is so that the browser connects to it correctly. Typical schemes for web browsing are http and https. A scheme is always part of the URL, but is not always displayed by the browser.
#### Domain: www.amazon.com
The domain name is the most prominent component of a URL. Different pages on the same site will typically use the same domain name. Each segment of the domain name seperated by a perios is called a domain.
#### Top level domain: .edu
The domain on the right of a URL is called the top-level domain. This domain usually gives you more information on what kind of site it is. The top-level domain .gov is used for goverment sites in the United States. The domain .edu is reserved for organizations with a focus on education like universities.
#### Default page: no file path provided
URLs that end with a domain name and no file path will usually load  a default page. This page is designed to help users navigate to a specific page on the site.
#### Parameters: result of search
Parameters are strings of characters that sometimes appear after the path Parameters can be seen after performing a search on a site like Google or YouTube.
#### Anchor: specific location on a page
The anchor tells the browser to load or scroll to a specific part of the page. The anchor also appears after the path and typicall begins with a hashtag.
