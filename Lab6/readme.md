#### IP Address
Internet Protocol (IP) address is a unique number assigned to a specific computer that is connected to the internet. IPv4 is the original version of an IP address. IPv4 address are made up of four numbers between 0 and 255, separated by dots. IPv4 can only have around four billion unique IP addresses which is not enough for the number of internet devices used today. IPv6 was developed to increase the number of available IP addresses. IPv6 addresses are made up of eight hexadecimal numbers, separated by colons. IPv6 has enough space for 340 undecillion addresses.
#### ICANN
ICANN is a not-for-profit public-benefit corporation with a mission of keeping the internet secure and stable. ICANN is the operator of Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) functions and allocates IP address blocks to the five Regional Internet Registries (RIR) around the world. Those RIRs then allocate smaller blocks to Internet Service Providers (ISP). The ISPs then assign address to individual internet connections. ICANN is at the top of the herachy for distributing IP addresses.
