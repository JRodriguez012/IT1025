### Executive Summary

For my project, I decided to create a game using Python and Pygame. Since I used Python for the first time in one of the labs, I decided to explore the language further within a context that I am interested in. Pygame is a cross-platform library for creating games with the Python programming language. Pygame is a set of modules that handle things like windows, graphics, input, and collisions to allow developers to create games quickly. My goal was to create a small game in which a player has 3 lives to shoot enemies and score points. I was not able to fully complete my goal due to time, but I now have a better understanding of Python and creating games.

### Part Part 1: Project Intent and Plan

I intend to pursue option 2 and implement code. I plan to create a game using Pyton and Pygame. I want to create a arcade shooter game where the player has three lives to clear waves of enemies to score points. The player can move with W, A, S, D, and can shoot with spacebar. Enemies will spawn off screen and chase the player. The player will earn points by destroying enemies. When an enemy hits a player, the player will lose a life. The game is over when the player loses three lives.

### Project Part 2:

My program is a top down shooter game. In this game, you play as a small cube man who must shoot deformed cube enemies to survive. The player can move using the W, A, S, D keys. The player cannot move off of the screen. The player can rotate by moving the mouse and can shoot in the direction of the mouse by holding down the left mouse button. Enemies spawn in a random position on the screen every 3 seconds. The player must shoot an enemy to kill it. The game is over when an enemy touches the player.
