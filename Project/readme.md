### Part Part 1: Project Intent and Plan

I intend to pursue option 2 and implement code. I plan to create a game using Pyton and Pygame. I want to create a arcade shooter game where the player has three lives to clear waves of enemies to score points. The player can move with W, A, S, D, and can shoot with spacebar. Enemies will spawn off screen and chase the player. The player will earn points by destroying enemies. When an enemy hits a player, the player will lose a life. The game is over when the player loses three lives.

### Project Part 2:

If you elected option 1 describe the process you followed to become co-op ready and the name of your career coach OR, for option 2, present your program, application, reach etc.  There is no specific guidelines on the length or development success.  Some students plan on creating an app and find that they only got to determining the full purpose, outcomes and technology which is fine.  The purpose of the project is to take a topic of particular interest to you and spend some more time to gain a deeper level of understanding.
