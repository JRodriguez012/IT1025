## Software
There are a few different categories of software. Operating systems manage all of the programs that run on the computer. They provide users with a user-interface, the ability to manage the hardware resources of the computer, and a platform for software developers to write applications. Application software exist to perform a specific task. Productivity software like word processors, spreadsheets, and presentation software are types of application software that are often used in the workplace. Utility software allows a computer to be fixed or modified in some way. Utility software is made to fill shortcomings in operating systems.

## Virtualization
### Problems Solved by Virtualization
Virtualization allows servers to be used more efficiently, which decreases the cost of buying and maintaining servers. If you have a number of servers that run individual tasks and each server is being used at a fraction of its capacity, virtualization can split a single server into multiple parts that can handle their independent tasks.
### Role of Hypervisor
A hypervisor is a software that seperates the physical resources of a machine from the virtual machine and divides up those resources to be used by the virtual environment. Hypervisors can be installed directly onto hardware like a server, or sit on top of an operating system.
## Python
### Pseudo-Code Nature of Python
Pseudo-code is a plain language description of the steps of a piece of code. It has the structure of a programming language, but is meant to be read by humans rather than a machine. The pseudo-code nature of Python describes how Python code is able to be read like english.

### Interpreted vs. Compiled Language
A compiled language is a language that has to be compiled meaning the source language is converted into a language that is used by the computer. When a program written in a compiled language is run, the linker/loader software copies the program from hard disk to memory and runs it. An interpreted language does not need to be compiled. A program written in an interpreted language can run directly from the source code.
