## Executive Summary 
Lab 3 covers the different types of software and how businesses use Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software to manage the important components of their business. Virtualization allows hardware to be used more efficiently by dividing up a machine's resources to be to be used by a virtual environment for an individual task. In this lab, we also learn about the Python programming language and some of the basics of programming with Python. Finally, we explore careers in computing, certificates for advancing a career in computing, and the benefits of pursuing a co-op or internship.
## Software
There are a few different categories of software. Operating systems manage all the programs that run on the computer. They provide users with a user-interface, the ability to manage the hardware resources of the computer, and a platform for software developers to write applications. Application software exists to perform a specific task. Productivity software like word processors, spreadsheets, and presentation software are types of application software that are often used in the workplace. Utility software allows a computer to be fixed or modified in some way. Utility software is made to fill shortcomings in operating systems.
### Types of Software
* Operating Systems (Ex. Microsoft Windows)
* Application Software (Ex. Microsoft Word)
* Utility Software (Ex. Windows Defender)
### ERP
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are used to bring an organization's information under centralized control. ERP software utilizes a central database that is used by many employees of an organization to edit and save information from the same data source. ERP systems include different modules that provide functionality for each of the essential components of a business. Systems Analysis and Program Development (SAP) is an example of ERP software that provides large organizations with the ability to manage components of their business such as finances, order management, supply chain, etc.

## Virtualization
### Problems Solved by Virtualization
Virtualization allows servers to be used more efficiently, which decreases the cost of buying and maintaining servers. If you have several servers that run individual tasks and each server is being used at a fraction of its capacity, virtualization can split a single server into multiple parts that can handle their independent tasks.
### Role of Hypervisor
A hypervisor is a software that separates the physical resources of a machine from the virtual machine and divides up those resources to be used by the virtual environment. Hypervisors can be installed directly onto hardware like a server or sit on top of an operating system.
## Python
### Pseudo-Code Nature of Python
Pseudo-code is a plain language description of the steps of a piece of code. It has the structure of a programming language but is meant to be read by humans rather than a machine. The pseudo-code nature of Python describes how Python code can be read like English.

### Interpreted vs. Compiled Language
A compiled language is a language that has to be compiled meaning the source language is converted into a language that is used by the computer. When a program written in a compiled language is run, the linker/loader software copies the program from hard disk to memory and runs it. An interpreted language does not need to be compiled. A program written in an interpreted language can run directly from the source code.

## Career Exploration
### Handshake
I found it easy to activate my Handshake account and setup my profile. I am very interested in obtaining a software engineering internship sometime in the future, so I will definitely be using Handshake to look for an opportunity to do so. In the short time that I spent on Handshake, I have already learned about some of the opportunities in the Cleveland area that I likely would not have known about otherwise.
### Bureau of Labor Statistics
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the median pay for software developers in 2020 was $110,140 per year. Software developers typically need a bachelor's degree in computer and information technology or a related field. The employment of software developers is projected to grow 22 percent from 2020 to 2030, much faster than the average for all occupations. On average there are projected to be 189,200 openings for software developers each year.
### Certifications
Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) is a cybersecurity certification that verifies an individual can effectively design, implement, and manage a best-in-class cybersecurity program. CISSP is ideal for someone that wants to prove their knowledge in a variety of security practices and principles. Topics include security and risk management, asset security, security architecture and engineering, communication and network security, identity and access management, security assessment and testing, security operations, and software development security. To qualify for CISSP you must pass the exam and have at least five years of paid work experience.
### Certificates and Degrees
Tri-C offers a Post-Degree Certificate in Programming and Development. This certificate is designed to enhance skills in the object-oriented environment of programming, database, and web technologies. This program prepares students to apply knowledge of programming at the enterprise level using industry standards and tools.
### Co-ops / Internships
To become co-op ready, students must first participate in the co-op orientation process through the Career Center. They must upload a resume for approval by a Career Coach at Handshake. They then work with an Employer Relations Specialist to apply and interview with co-op placements. Finally, they must complete and sign a "Cooperative Education Agreement" form and register for college credit. Co-ops and internships provide students with real-world experience to prepare for jobs related to their field. These forms of experiential learning boost student's marketability and allow them to use what they learned in the classroom.
### Industry Associations / Student Organizations
Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) is a competition that provides institutions with a controlled, competitive environment to assess student's understanding in the skills required to protect a corporate network infrastructure. This program was designed to give students the opportunity to apply the skills they have learned in the classroom and to encourage teamwork and communication within and among teams.
## Conclusion
In this lab, I learned the value of virtualization for using hardware efficiently. Before this lab, I assumed there was a separate machine for each service. I also learned more about the Python programming language. I have heard of Python before but have never used it. It feels strange to not use any brackets or semicolons, but I see how the lack of focus on syntax can make code more readable. I activated my handshake account and explored some of the opportunities in my area and across the country. I am excited to use the tools and knowledge from this lab to prepare myself for obtaining an internship in the future.
