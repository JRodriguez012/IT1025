## Data, Information and Knowledge
### Compare and contrast data, information and knowledge
Data are the raw facts that often do not have context. Data can be quantative, a value that can be measured, or qualitative, a description. Information is processed data that has context, relevance, and purpose. Information typically manipulates data to see trends in patterns in the data. Knowledge is a perception about the relationships among relevant facts. Knowledge is information that facilitates action.

### Relational Data
#### Primary Key: The primary key for the customers table would be a customer ID. The primary keys for the orders table would be a customer ID and an order number.
#### Relationship between customers and orders: The customers and order tables would be related by their shared customer ID.
#### Foreign key of orders table:
### Field Data Types

### Big Data
#### Four "V"s of Big Data
The four "V"s of big data are volume, variety, velocity, variability. Volume is related to the enormous size of big data. Variety refers to heterogeneous sources of both structured and unstructured data. Data can be in the form of spreadsheets, audio, pictures, videos, etc. Velocity refers to the speed at which data is generated and processed. Variability is the inconsistency which is shown by data, hampering the process of managing data effectively.
#### Technology Driving the need for Big Data
Technology such as search engines and social media platforms have significantly increased the need for big data.

## Structured Query Language (SQL) 
### RDBMS and SQL
Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is the basis for SQL. RDBMS uses database objects called tables to store data. A table is a collection of related data entries that is broken up into smaller entries called fields. Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard language that is used to retrieve data from and manipulate data in relational databases. SQL is the language used to access and interact with RDBMS.
### Relationship, Primary and Foreign Keys

## SQL Injections
SQL injections are a security threat because they can be used to access data inside or destroy your database. SQL injections use web page inputs to place malicious code in SQL statements. To reduce threats from SQL injections, use SQL parameters. SQL parameters are values that are added to an SQL query at execution time, in a controlled maner. SQL parameters are checked by the SQL engine to ensure they are treated literally, not as part of SQL to be executed.
