## Lucidchart
Lucidchart is a tool used for creating diagrams. It was incredibly easy to sign up and create a diagram for a program. I like being able to plan out the individual pieces of a program and seeing how the program flows as a whole. I think Lucidchart is a great tool for planning and visualizing programs.

## Introduction to Networking

### Data Transmission
#### Packet: Unit of data. 
When a message is sent over the internet it is broken down intto smaller pieces, called packets. A packet contains the sender's address, the destination address, a sequence number, and a piece of the overall message that is sent.
#### Packet-Switching: Technology that allows packets of data to be routed base on destination address
#### IP Address: Unique identifying number

#### DNS: Directory of IP address common names

#### Protocol: Set of rules to allow devices to communicate

### Networking Hardware
#### Switch vs. Hub
A hub connects devices together on an internal network by accepting ethernet connections from those devices through its ports. A hub only knows whether a device is connected to it, it does not know to which device data is supposed to be sent. When data arrives to one of the hub's ports, that data is copied to all of its other ports. A switch is like a hub in that it connects devices on an internal network through ethernet connections. Unlike a hub, a switch stores physical addresses (MAC address) of the devices connected to it. When a switch receives data, it can direct that data to the intended destination port. Switches are preferred to hubs because they reduce unnecessary traffic on the network.

#### Router vs. Switch and Hub
Switches and hubs are used to exchange data within a local area network. They cannot be used to exchange data outside of their own network because they are not capable of reading IP addresses. The benefit of routers over hubs and switches is its ability to connect networks. A router routes data from one network to another based on their IP address. When a router receives a data packet, the router inspects the data's IP address and determines if the packet was meant for its own network or another network. If the data was meant for its own network it receives it. If the data was not meant for its own network it sends the data off to another network.
### Network Topologies
#### Single point of Failure
A single point of failure is a part of a network that, if it fails, will cause the entire network to go down. Topologies that experience this issue are the star, ring, and bus topologies.
#### Infrastrucutre vs. Wireless Mesh
The infrastructure topology uses a combination of wired and wireless devices. In an infrastructure topology, wired devices are physically connected to a switch and a wireless access point that allows wireless devices to connect to the network is also physically connected to the same switch. The wireless access point acts as a bridge between the wired and wireless networks. The wireless mesh topology is similar to the infrasture topology in that you have a wireless access point physically connected to a switch. But in a wireless mesh, each wireless access point will talk to other wireless access points that are not physically connected to the switch. When a device connects to a wireless access point, its connection is relayed between wireless access points until it reaches back to the modem. I think that the wireless mesh topology is better as the wireless network will remain up if any one of the wireless access points that are not connected to the switch fails. You also have the ability to extend your wireless network as wide as you want without the use of physical cables.

## Cybersecurity and Encryption

### Information Systems Security

#### Security Triad
Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) make up the security triad. 
#### Authentication
Entering your house requires authentication because you need a key to unlock the door. This could be converted to multi-factor authentication with an alarm system. You would the key to unlock the door and the code to disable the alarm system. Checking emails require authentication as you need to know your email address and password. Many email services provide multi-factor authentication by texting a code to a linked phone number. THIRD ONE!!!!!!!
#### ACL and RBAC
Access Control List (ACL) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) are access control models that determine which users are authorized to read, modify, add, or delete information. ACLs give individual users access to information resources. The advantage of ACLs is that they are simple to understand and maintain with a small number of users and resources. But as the number of users and information resources grow, ACLs become harder to maintain as it is much more tedious when a administrator has to add or remove a user from a large set of information resources. RBACs assign roles to users and then those roles are assigned access to information resources. The advantage of RBACs is that users and roles can be managed seperately which simplifies administration and improves security. The disadvantage of RBACs is the inability to give an individual user specific rights without creating an entirely new role.
