## Python IDLE
The interactive shell is good for running Python instructions one at a time as the shell runs the instruction that you typed as soon as you press ENTER. The file editor is for writing entire Python programs. With the file editor, you can type in multiple instructions, save the file, and run the entire program. The file editor can open these saved files to be reloaded and edited later on. You can tell the difference between the file editor and the shell because the shell has the >>> prompt while the file editor does not.
