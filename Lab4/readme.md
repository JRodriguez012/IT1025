## Python IDLE
The interactive shell is good for running Python instructions one at a time as the shell runs the instruction that you typed as soon as you press ENTER. The file editor is for writing entire Python programs. With the file editor, you can type in multiple instructions, save the file, and run the entire program. The file editor can open these saved files to be reloaded and edited later on. You can tell the difference between the file editor and the shell because the shell has the >>> prompt while the file editor does not.

## Code Examples
### Variable:
Ex. myName

A variable is a space in the computer's memory where you can store a single value. Variables can be used to retrieve values in different parts of your program. The author uses the variable names spam, bacon, and eggs as generic names used for examples. These generic names were inspired by Monty Python "Spam" sketch.
### Assignment statement:
Ex. myName = 'Javi'

Assignment statements are used to store values in variables. An assignment statement consist of a variable, an equal sign, and the value that will be stored. In the example, the value 'Javi' is stored in the variable myName.
### Function:
Ex. print(myName)

A function is a piece of code that does a specific task. Functions sometimes take arguments, values that are passed to the function that the function can then use to do its task. The print function takes a string value as an argument and displays that string on the screen as text.
### Three data types:
Ex. integer (5), floating-point number (5.0), string ('5', 'Javi')

A data type is a category of values. Every value belongs to exactly one data type. The integer (int) data type describes a whole number. Floating-point numbers (floats) are numbers with a decimal point. A string is a group of characters surronded by single quote (') characters that note where the string begins and ends. The string value is the text value where the single quote characters are ignored.
## Graphics

### Raster vs. Vector Graphics
A raster image is made up of thousands of tiny pixels. Small raster images lose quality when they are enlarged because these individual pixels become more visible. Vector graphics are rendered using a special form of geometry. Vector graphics are able to be enlarged without losing quality. Raster images are used more for photography, while vector graphics are used more in the professional design world for logos, fonts, etc.
### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
The decision to use lossless or lossy image depends on what the developer's needs are for the image. If a high quality image is necessary, a lossless image format should be used as all the data from the original image is preserved. If keeping file sizes small is important, a lossy image format should be used as some of the original image data is removed and the file size is reduced.
### File Formats
GIF is a good file format for simple graphics as it supports up to 8 bits per pixel, therefore an image can have up to 256 distinct RGB colors. Unlike the other two formats, GIFs allow for animated images. JPEG is an appropriate format for photos without high contrast. JPEGs allow the designer to adjust the amopunt of compression used. Both GIFs and JPEGs are both suitable for keeping file sizes small. PNG is an good format for illustrations and photos with high contrast. PNGs support transparency including alpha channel transparency. Both GIFs and PNGs use loseless compression, while JPEGs use lossy compression for files.
